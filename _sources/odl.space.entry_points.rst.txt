entry_points
============

Entry points for adding more spaces to ODL using external packages.

External packages can add implementations of `NtuplesBase` and `FnBase` by
hooking into the setuptools entry point ``'odl.space'`` and exposing the
methods ``ntuples_impls`` and ``fn_impls``.


Attributes
----------
NTUPLES_IMPLS: dict
    A dictionary that maps a string to an `NtuplesBase` implementation.
FN_IMPLS: dict
    A dictionary that maps a string to an `FnBase` implementation.

Notes
-----
This is used with functions such as `rn`, `fn` and `uniform_discr` in order
to allow arbitrary implementations.
